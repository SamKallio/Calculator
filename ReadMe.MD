# Calculator

Functional and simple calculator made with JS, CSS and HTML. Contains all basic functionality of a calculator. You can sum, substract, multiply, divide, use modulo operator and add brackets to calculate either decimal or integer numbers.

Evaluation of expressions is done using MathJS library.

The Purpose of this little project was to just practice evaluating user input so that it can be evaluated mathematically.

## Known issues / TODO

- Expression errors are not descriptive of each error scenario (Basically you need to know math in order to know what was the error)
